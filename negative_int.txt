One's Complement:
Let D= the number we wish to convert from decimal to binary
Find P, such that 2^P is the largest power of two smaller than D.
Repeat until P<0
If 2^P<=D then
put 0 into column P
subtract 2^P from D
Else
put 1 into column P
End if
Subtract 1 from P 


Negative numbers are written as bits in the same way as the positive integer compliments except you replace the 0s with 1s, and 1s with 0s. A positive integer's negative compliment is found by increasing the positive number by one and multiplying by -1.
